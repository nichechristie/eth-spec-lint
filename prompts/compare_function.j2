You are an Ethereum protocol security auditor. Compare the following Ethereum consensus specification function against its client implementation. Identify any semantic differences that could cause consensus failures.

## Specification Function: `{{ spec_name }}`

```python
{{ spec_source }}
```

## Client Implementation: `{{ client_name }}`

```typescript
{{ client_source }}
```

## Instructions

Analyze both code snippets and identify any discrepancies. For each finding, classify it into one of these categories:

- **LOGIC_DIVERGENCE**: The implementation does not match the spec logic
- **MISSING_CHECK**: A validation or boundary check in the spec is absent from the implementation
- **CONSTANT_MISMATCH**: A constant value differs between spec and implementation
- **TYPE_MISMATCH**: Types or data structures differ in a meaningful way
- **OFF_BY_ONE**: An off-by-one error in loop bounds, array indexing, or comparisons
- **OPTIMIZATION_SAFE**: Implementation differs but is provably equivalent (safe optimization)

Respond with a JSON array of findings. If no issues are found, return an empty array `[]`.

Each finding must have this structure:
```json
{
  "category": "LOGIC_DIVERGENCE",
  "severity": "error",
  "summary": "Short description of the issue",
  "detail": "Detailed explanation of the discrepancy and its potential impact",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

Severity levels: "error" (consensus-critical), "warning" (potentially unsafe), "note" (informational).
Confidence: 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how certain you are this is a real issue.

Only report genuine discrepancies. Do not flag language-level differences (Python vs TypeScript idioms) that do not affect semantics.
